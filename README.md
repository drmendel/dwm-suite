# dwm suite

My personal **dwm** setup — minimal, fast, and clean.  
It combines **dmenu**, **dwm**, and **dwmblocks** into a single build system with an unified look.

## 🪶 Design
- Minimal black and gray color scheme  
- Simple, elegant status bar using `dwmblocks`  
- Clean typography and layout  
- Focused on performance and usability

## ⚙️ Components
- **dmenu** – launcher  
- **dwm** – window manager  
- **dwmblocks** – modular status bar  

## 🔧 Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drmendel/dwm-suite.git
cd dwm-suite
sudo ./make.sh clean install
```
